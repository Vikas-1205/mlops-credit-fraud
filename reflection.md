# Reflection on Using ChatGPT as a Coding Assistant

### 🧠 Experience Summary
Using ChatGPT throughout this MLOps exercise helped me streamline the entire development lifecycle — from idea to working pipeline — within a short time frame.

---

### ⚙️ What Worked Well
- Helped structure the **MLflow integration** quickly and clearly.  
- Provided accurate examples of **FastAPI model deployment** code.  
- Guided the addition of **SMOTE balancing**, which significantly improved performance.  
- Made it easy to write a **clean and professional README.md** aligned with industry standards.

---

### ⚠️ What Needed Adjustment
- Some suggestions (like Dockerization and Kubernetes) were beyond the 1-hour scope, so I simplified them.  
- ChatGPT occasionally gave extra-complex code snippets that I optimized for readability and simplicity.

---

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- Accelerated the overall coding speed by around **40–50%**.  
- Reduced time spent on debugging and syntax recalls.  
- Helped maintain **consistent documentation and clarity** across the entire project.  
- Enabled faster experimentation and idea validation during pipeline design.

### ✅ Overall Reflection
ChatGPT acted as a **pair programmer and technical reviewer**, keeping me focused on logic while handling repetitive or structural tasks.  
It ensured that the final project adhered to **MLOps best practices**: reproducibility, automation, and maintainability.

This experience demonstrated how using an AI assistant effectively can **boost productivity**, improve code quality, and enhance project presentation for professional evaluation.
